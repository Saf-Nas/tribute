        <p>A seasoned Executive passionate about growing human capital assets and strengthening business performance.

By developing organisational structures, incentivising talent development, and implementing functioning work systems, Wazen Oil Services is leading the industry and working to set an example for how the private sector can effect change in the public domain and raise operational standards.</p>
